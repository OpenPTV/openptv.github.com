# Mozart

The Mozart Programming System combines ongoing research in programming language
design and implementation, constraint logic programming, distributed computing,
and human-computer interfaces.

Mozart provides expressive power and advanced functionality. It comes with both
32 and 64-bit implementations, and provides both compiled and REPL interpreter
execution for incremental development and experimentation.
