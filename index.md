<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p> OpenPTV is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">standing on the shoulders of giants </a>. 
The origins are from the <a href="http://3dptv.github.com">3D-PTV</a> software, developed for years at ETH Zurich. Since then few additional branches of the software have been developed independently by TU/e group of <a href="http://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/applied-physics/research/transport-physics/turbulence-and-vortex-dynamics-wdy/">Turbulence and Vortex Dynamics</a> (C++ version with Tcl/Tk and few new algorithms of general coordinate transformation) and by the <a href="http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/turbulencelab">Turbulence Structure Laboratory</a> at Tel Aviv University (Python version, PyPTV) </p>
