### What is OpenPTV
OpenPTV foundation is a collaborative effort of several research groups to join in order to develop a better software for [three-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking velocimetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_tracking_velocimetry). 


OpenPTV is [standing on the shoulders of giants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). 
The origins are from the [3D-PTV](http://3dptv.github.com) software, developed for years at ETH Zurich. Since then few additional branches of the software have been developed independently by TU/e group of [Turbulence and Vortex Dynamics](http://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/applied-physics/research/transport-physics/turbulence-and-vortex-dynamics-wdy/) (C++ version with Tcl/Tk and few new algorithms of general coordinate transformation) and by the [Turbulence Structure Laboratory](http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/turbulencelab) at Tel Aviv University (Python version, PyPTV).
