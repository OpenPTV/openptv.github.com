# The Mozart Programming System

The Mozart Programming System combines ongoing research in programming language
design and implementation, constraint logic programming, distributed computing,
and human-computer interfaces. Mozart implements the Oz language and provides
both expressive power and advanced functionality.

## Mozart 2

The PLDC Research Group at UCL is proud to announce the first release of Mozart
2. This release contains a completely redesigned 64-bit virtual machine
(compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit processors), and adds an extension interface
to the virtual machine to allow language extensions defined within Oz. The PLDC
Research Group will use Mozart 2 for future programming education and future
research in programming language design and implementation.

The first release of Mozart 2 does not provide support for constraints or
distributed programming. We plan for successive releases to support constraint
programming with an interface to the Gecode system, and to support distributed
programming with a peer-to-peer transactional storage and extensions for
network-transparent and synchronization-free programming.

## Mozart 1.3.2 and 1.4.0

Previous versions of Mozart, in particular Mozart 1.3.2 and Mozart 1.4.0,
[remain available to download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mozart-oz/files/v1). They will be deprecated when
Mozart 2 is released with constraint and distribution support.
