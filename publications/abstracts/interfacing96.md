This paper describes a C++ interface for the concurrent constraint
language Oz to implement non-basic constraints as propagators. The
programmer benefits from the advantages of a high-level language, like
elegant and 
concise coding, in conjunction with efficiency. For the user it
is transparent whether a constraint is implemented by an Oz procedure or
through the interface. The interface is completely separated from the
underlying Oz implementation. Moreover, it frees the user from tedious
tasks like suspending and waking up constraints.

The overall efficiency of the resulting system is comparable to existing
finite domain systems. For scheduling applications we demonstrate how
algorithms from Operations Research can be incorporated, which allows to
obtain results comparable to commercially available systems.
