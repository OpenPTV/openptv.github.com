Oz is a concurrent constraint language providing for first-class
procedures, concurrent objects, and encapsulated search. DFKI Oz is an
interactive implementation of Oz competitive in performance with
commercial Prolog and Lisp systems.  This paper describes AMOZ, the
abstract machine underlying DFKI Oz. AMOZ implements rational tree
constraints, first-class procedures, local computation spaces for deep
guards, and preemptive and fair threads.
