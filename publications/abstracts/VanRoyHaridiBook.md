[BibTeX Entry](http://www.mozart-oz.org/papers/abstracts/VanRoyHaridiBook.bib)



This textbook is designed for second-year courses up to graduate
courses in computer programming.  It covers all major programming
concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework.  It
is based on the kernel language approach, in which
programming languages are defined in terms of their underlying
concepts.  The textbook defines a wide variety of programming
languages and paradigms with a small set of closely-related
kernel languages.  The kernel languages are easy to understand by
practicing programmers and have a simple formal semantics that
makes it easy to reason about correctness and complexity at a
high level of abstraction.  The textbook is designed to be used
together with the Mozart
Programming System.
