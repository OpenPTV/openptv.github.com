  abstract={I sketch a general model of constraint-based problem solving that is not committed
to a particular programming paradigm, show that Prolog in particular and logic
programming in general do not provide a satisfactory framework for constraint
programming, and outline how constraint programming is realized in Oz, a 
general-purpose language for symbolic processing.}
