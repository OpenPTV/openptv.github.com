We present an experimental C interface to Oz, which enables programmers
to add metaterms to the DFKI Oz system in a modular way.  Low-level
issues, as garbage collection and waking up suspended computation, are
transparent. Metaterms are fully compatible with the other
components of the system, as for example the Oz Browser.


Metaterms are a well-suited means to implement instances of the clpx(X)
framework. To demonstrate the use of the interface we implement a solver
for clp(Real Intervals).
