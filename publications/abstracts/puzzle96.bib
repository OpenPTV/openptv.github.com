  abstract={This paper is about how to solve a class of puzzles, called
self-referential quizzes (\textit{srq}), with
constraint programming. An \textit{srq} is a
sequence of multiple choice questions that are about the puzzle
itself. \textit{srq}s are an attractive pastime, when they provide the
possibility of drawing non-trivial conclusions on the way to the
solution.

We introduce a typical \textit{srq}, and represent it as
a propositional satisfiability problem. Its straightforward
clausal representation is too big for effective 
treatment using standard methods. Instead, we solve it
with finite domain constraint programming.
For this application
of constraint programming, support of logic connectives such
as conjunction and disjunction is crucial. 
With their small problem descriptions,
\textit{srq}s are ideal candidates for benchmarks
covering the implementation of 0/1 variables in 
constraint programming languages.}
