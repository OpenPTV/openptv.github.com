This paper presents a lightweight reliable object
migration protocol that preserves the centralized
object semantics, allows for precise prediction of
network behavior, and permits construction of
fault tolerance abstractions in the language.
Each object has a "home site" to which all
migration requests are directed.  Compared to the
standard technique of creating and collapsing
forwarding chains, this gives a better worst-case
network behavior and it limits dependencies on
third-party sites.  The protocol defines "freely
mobile" objects that have the interesting
property of always executing locally, i.e., each
method executes in the thread that invokes it.
This makes them dual, in a precise sense, to
stationary objects.  The protocol is designed to
be as efficient as a nonreliable protocol in the
common case of no failure, and to provide
sufficient hooks so that common fault tolerance
algorithms can be programmed completely in the Oz
language.  The protocol is fully implemented in
the network layer of the Mozart platform for
distributed application development, which
implements Oz (see http://www.mozart-oz.org).
This paper defines the protocol in an intuitive
yet precise way using the concept of
*distribution graph* to model distributed
execution of language entities.  Formalization and
proof of protocol properties are done elsewhere.
