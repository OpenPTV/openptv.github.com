        Abstract = {This lecture introduces concurrent constraint
programming in
     Mozart/Oz and shows how to model natural language processing on
basis
     of this paradigm. The lecture addresses students
     of computer science who are interested in constraint programming
     or Mozart/Oz and students of computational linguistics who
     want to learn natural language processing with modern
     programming technology beyond Prolog and LISP.


    The following topics are introduced, all of which come with running
    programs and lots of practical exercises:

      functional programming and data structures in Mozart/Oz,
      chart parsing for context free grammars,
      unification based parsing,
      concurrent constraint programming,
      constraint solving for scope underspecification in natural
language semantics,
      constraint solving for parsing with dependency grammar.


   The lectures presupposes as few knowledge as possible, so that it can

   address students of computer science and computational linguistics
   simultaneously. }
