We investigate concurrency as unifying computational paradigm
which integrates functional, constraint, and object-oriented 
programming. We propose the Rho-calculus as a uniform 
foundation of concurrent computation and formally relate it 
to other models: The Rho-calculus with equational constraints 
provides for logic variables and is bisimilar to the 
Gamma-calculus. The Rho-calculus without constraints 
is a proper subset of the Pi-calculus. We prove its Turing 
completeness by embedding the eager Lambda-calculus in 
continuation passing style. The Rho-calculus over an 
arbitrary constraint system is an extension of the standard 
cc-model with procedural abstraction.
