The paper presents an extension of the concurrent constraint model
providing for higher-order programming, deep guards, and encapsulated
search.  The paper focuses on a higher-order combinator providing for
encapsulated search.  The search combinator spawns a local computation
space and resolves remaining choices by returning the alternatives as
first-class citizens.  The search combinator allows to program different
search strategies, including depth-first, indeterministic one solution,
demand-driven multiple solution, all solutions, and best solution
(branch and bound) search.  The described computation model is realized
in Oz, a programming language and system under development at
DFKI.
