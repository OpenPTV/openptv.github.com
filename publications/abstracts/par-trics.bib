  abstract = {Search in constraint programming is a time consuming task.
  Search can be speeded up by exploring subtrees of a search tree
  in parallel. This paper presents distributed search engines
  that achieve parallelism by distribution across networked
  computers.  The main point of the paper is a simple design of
  the parallel search engine. Simplicity comes as an immediate
  consequence of clearly separating search, concurrency, and
  distribution. The obtained distributed search engines are
  simple yet offer substantial speedup on standard network
  computers.},
