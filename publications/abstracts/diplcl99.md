The Mozart Programming System
is a development platform
designed for distributed programming,
symbolic computation, and constraint-based inferencing.
This article gives a survey of
the abilities of Mozart
for open, concurrent, resource-aware distributed computing.
We show by example how easy it is to
develop applications with these properties.
This makes Mozart particularly well-suited
for building agent applications.
We give a summary of some current
agent-based projects in Mozart.
