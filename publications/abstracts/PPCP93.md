Oz is a higher-order concurrent constraint programming
system under development at DFKI.  It combines ideas from logic
and concurrent programming in a simple yet expressive language.  From
logic programming Oz inherits logic variables and logic data
structures, which provide for a programming style where partial
information about the values of variables is imposed concurrently and
incrementally.  A novel feature of Oz is the support of
higher-order programming without sacrificing that denotation and
equality of variables are captured by first-order logic.  Another new
feature of Oz are cells, a concurrent construct providing a minimal form of
state fully compatible with logic data structures. 
These two features allow to express objects as procedures with state,
avoiding the problems of stream communication, the conventional
communication mechanism employed in concurrent logic programming.


Based on cells and higher-order programming, Oz
readily supports concurrent object-oriented programming including
object identity, late method binding, multiple inheritance, "self",
"super", batches,  synchronous and asynchronous communication.
