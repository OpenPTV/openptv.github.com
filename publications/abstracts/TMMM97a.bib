  abstract={We report on the extension of the concurrent constraint language Oz by
constraints over finite sets of integers.  Set constraints are an
important addition to the constraint programming system Oz and are
very employable in natural language processing and general problem
solving.  This extension profits much from its integration with the
existing constraint systems over finite domains and feature trees, as
well as from the availability of first-class procedures. This
combination of features is unique to Oz.  This paper focuses on the
expressiveness gained by set constraints and on the benefits of the
integration with finite domain constraints. A number of case studies
demonstrates  programming techniques exploring these advantages.}
