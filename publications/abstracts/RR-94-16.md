We present the -calculus, a
computational calculus for
higher-order concurrent programming.  The calculus can elegantly
express higher-order functions (both eager and lazy) and concurrent
objects with encapsulated state and multiple inheritance.  The
primitives of the -calculus are logic
variables, names,
procedural abstraction, and cells.  Cells provide a notion of state
that is fully compatible with concurrency and constraints.  Although it
does not have a dedicated communication primitive, the -calculus
can elegantly express one-to-many and many-to-one communication.


There is an interesting relationship between the -calculus and
the -calculus: The -calculus is subsumed by a calculus
obtained by extending the asynchronous and polyadic -calculus with
logic variables.


The -calculus can be extended with
primitives providing for
constraint-based problem solving in the style of logic programming.
A such extended -calculus has the
remarkable property that it
combines first-order constraints with higher-order programming.
