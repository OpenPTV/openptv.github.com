Constraint programming is an approach to modeling and solving combinatorial
problems that has proven succesful in many applications. Building on
techniques developed in AI, logic programming and operations research, 
constraint programming is based on an abstraction that decomposes the
problem solver into a reusable constraint engine and a declarative
program modeling the problem.




This book is concerned with the architecture and implementation of constraint
engines. The author's main contribution is that constraint services,
such as search and combinators, are made programmable; this is achieved
by devising computation spaces as simple abstraction for programming
constraint services at a high level. State-of-the-art and novel search
strategies, such as visual interactive search and parallel search
are covered.




The book is indispensible reading for anyone seriously interested in 
constraint technology.
