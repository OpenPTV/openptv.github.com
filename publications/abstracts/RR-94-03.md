We present a calculus providing an abstract operational semantics for
higher-order concurrent constraint programming.  The calculus is
parameterized with a first-order constraint system and provides
first-class abstraction, guarded disjunction, committed-choice, deep
guards, dynamic creation of unique names, and constraint communication.
The calculus comes with a declarative sublanguage for which computation
amounts to equivalence transformation of formulas.  The declarative
sublanguage can express negation.


Abstractions are referred to by names, which are first-class values.
This way we obtain a smooth and straightforward combination of
first-order constraints with higher-order programming.


Constraint communication is asynchronous and exploits the presence of
logic variables.  It provides a notion of state that is fully compatible
with constraints and concurrency.


The calculus serves as the semantic basis of Oz, a programming language
and system under development at DFKI.
