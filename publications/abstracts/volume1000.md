The Oz Programming Model (OPM) is a concurrent programming model subsuming
higher-order functional and object-oriented programming as facets of a general
model. This is particularly interesting for concurrent object-oriented
programming, for which no comprehensive formal model existed until now. The
model can be extended so that it can express encapsulated problem solvers
generalizing the problem solving capabilities of constraint logic programming.
OPM has been developed together with a concomitant programming language Oz,
which is designed for applications that require complex symbolic computations,
organization into multiple agents, and soft real-time control. An efficient,
robust, and interactive implementation of Oz is freely available.
