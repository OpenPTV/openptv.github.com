Nemhauser and Trick presented the problem of finding a timetable for
the 1997/98 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in basketball. Their
solution, found with a combination of integer programming and
exhaustive enumeration, was accepted by the ACC.




Finite-domain constraint programming is another programming technique
that can be used for solving combinatorial search problems such as
sport timetabling. This paper presents a solution of round robin
tournament planning based on finite-domain constraint programming. The
approach yields a dramatic performance improvement, which makes an
integrated interactive software solution feasible.
