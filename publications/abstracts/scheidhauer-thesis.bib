  abstract = {This thesis presents the design, implementation and
  evaluation of a virtual machine for the core language of Oz,
  which we call L. We present L for didactic reasons as an extension
  of a sublanguage of SML. The most important differences between L
  and SML are: logic variables, threads, synchronization and dynamic
  typing. Starting from an informal description of the dynamic
  semantics in terms of a graph model, we develop step by step on
  various levels of abstraction a virtual machine for L. We begin with
  a simple basic model. We then propose several optimizations of this
  model. Afterwards we keep refining our approach by addressing
  specific aspects of the implementation of the model. Finally we
  evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques using a set of larger
  real world applications. Further we show, that the implementation of
  the language is competitive with the fastest emulators for
  statically typed functional languages.},
