This thesis investigates languages that partially describe lambda terms.
In particular, beta reduction constraints are introduced,
which express that one lambda term beta-reduces to another.
We investigate the expressive power of beta reduction constraints
by relating them to parallelism constraints,
and give applications of beta reduction constraints
in semantical underspecification of computational linguistics.
