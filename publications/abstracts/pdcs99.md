One of the most important issues to address when designing an
object-oriented language for distributed programming is related to
object mobility. We present a new mobile state protocol for ensuring
mutually exclusive access to mobile objects and cells in Distributed
Oz. The protocol greatly improves the locality and scalability
properties. It also allows potentially to overcome the problem of fault
tolerance.
