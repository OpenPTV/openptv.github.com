In this paper, we concentrate on a typical scheduling problem: the
computation of a time table for a German college.  Like many other
scheduling problems, this problem contains a variety of complex
constraints and necessitates special-purpose search strategies.
Techniques from Operations Research and traditional constraint logic
programming are not able to express these constraints and search
strategies on a sufficiently high level of abstraction.  We show that
the higher-order concurrent constraint language Oz provides this
high-level expressivity, and can serve as a useful programming tool
for college time tabling.
