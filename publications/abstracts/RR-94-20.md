Oz is an attempt to create a high-level concurrent programming language
providing the problem solving capabilities of logic programming (i.e.,
constraints and search).  Its computation model can be seen as a rather
radical extension of the concurrent constraint model providing for
higher-order programming, deep guards, state, and encapsulated search.
This paper focuses on the most recent extension, a higher-order
combinator providing for encapsulated search.  The search combinator
spawns a local computation space and resolves remaining choices by
returning the alternatives as first-class citizens.  The search
combinator allows to program different search strategies, including
depth-first, indeterministic one solution, demand-driven multiple
solution, all solutions, and best solution (branch and bound) search.
The paper also discusses the semantics of integer and finite domain
constraints in a deep guard computation model.
