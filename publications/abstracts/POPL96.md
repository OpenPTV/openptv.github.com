*A longer and revised version is Joachim Niehren, Uniform Confluence in Concurrent Computation*


We investigate functional computation as a special form 
of concurrent computation. As formal basis, we use a 
uniformly confluent core of the -calculus,
which is
also contained in models of higher-order concurrent
constraint programming. We embed the call-by-need 
and the call-by-value -calculus
into the
-calculus. We prove that call-by-need
complexity is
dominated by call-by-value complexity. In contrast to 
the recently proposed call-by-need -calculus,
our concurrent call-by-need model incorporates mutual 
recursion and can be extended to cyclic data structures 
by means of constraints.
