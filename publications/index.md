![Cover of Dracos, Th. (Ed), 1996 book](http://www.ifu.ethz.ch/publications/software/ptv/book.jpg)


In 1996, ETH Zurich have organized a Short Course on "Three-Dimensional Velocity and Vorticity Measuring and Image Analysis Techniques". The lectures of this course (including those of Th. Dracos, A. Grün, H.-G. Maas, among the others) were published as ERCOFTAC Series Vol. 4, by Kluwer Academic Publishers.  The book  (ISBN: 0-7923-4256-9) is available from [Springer](http://www.springer.com/physics/classical+continuum+physics/book/978-0-7923-4256-4) (that acquired Kluwer) or from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Three-Dimensional-Velocity-Vorticity-Measuring-Techniques/dp/0792342569).
