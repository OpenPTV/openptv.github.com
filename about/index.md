# OpenPTV software

The OpenPTV, open source particle tracking velocimetry software includes the library, written in ANSI C, of the basic 
algorithms of stereoscopic matching, particle detection, epipolar geometry and tracking that allow a complete processing
of multi-camera images to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) motion of multiple objects. Typically the objects would be 
small particles (flow tracers) but can be, not exclusively, insects or fish, or even humans. 


## Backwards-compatibility

The software has been changing since the first days, due to different hardware, methods, algorithms, 
scientific questions, and programming skills of the developers. We try to keep (see the mailing list for the 
discussions) the backward compatibility using more or less the same simplest ASCII format for our configuration
files, inputs and outputs. This is, however, not promised so if you plan to upgrade the software, keep the older version
with your older data sets.
