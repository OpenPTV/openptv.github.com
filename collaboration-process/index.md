# Using Github

We use the github.com [Fork + Pull Model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 

It is recommended first to contact the [mailing list](/mailing-lists/), also by e-mail to ```openptv@googlegroups.com``` and suggest the issue that you plan to work on. Whether it is a small patch or a document fix, it is better that we do not repeat this work several times.
