The goal of this work is to derive four-voice music pieces from given
musical plans, which describe the harmonic flow and the intentions 
of a desired composition.
We developed the experimentation platform COMPOzE for intention-based
composition. COMPOzE is based on constraint
programming over finite domains of integers. We argue that constraint
programming
provides a suitable technology for this task and
that the libraries and tools available for 
the constraint programming system Oz 
effectively support the implementation of COMPOzE.
<P>
This work links the research areas of
of automatic music composition on one hand and finite domain
constraint programming on the other, and contributes the tool
COMPOzE, which practically demonstrates the potential of constraint
programming to open up new areas of application for automatic music 
composition.
