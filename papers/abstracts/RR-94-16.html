<p>We present the <img src="gamma.gif" alt="gamma">-calculus, a
computational calculus for
higher-order concurrent programming.  The calculus can elegantly
express higher-order functions (both eager and lazy) and concurrent
objects with encapsulated state and multiple inheritance.  The
primitives of the <img src="gamma.gif" alt="gamma">-calculus are logic
variables, names,
procedural abstraction, and cells.  Cells provide a notion of state
that is fully compatible with concurrency and constraints.  Although it
does not have a dedicated communication primitive, the <img
src="gamma.gif" alt="gamma">-calculus
can elegantly express one-to-many and many-to-one communication.</p>
<p>There is an interesting relationship between the <img
src="gamma.gif" alt="gamma">-calculus and
the <img src="pi.gif" alt="pi">-calculus: The <img src="gamma.gif"
alt="gamma">-calculus is subsumed by a calculus
obtained by extending the asynchronous and polyadic <img src="pi.gif"
alt="pi">-calculus with
logic variables.</p>
<p>The <img src="gamma.gif" alt="gamma">-calculus can be extended with
primitives providing for
constraint-based problem solving in the style of logic programming.
A such extended <img src="gamma.gif" alt="gamma">-calculus has the
remarkable property that it
combines first-order constraints with higher-order programming.</p>
