<p>This short paper gives a one-page introduction to
the QTk user interface design tool and its underlying concepts.
It uses a mixed declarative/procedural approach to UI design
and is tightly integrated with a programming language that
has extensive support for records.
We give an example that shows the advantages of these
properties for executable model-based UI design.</p>
