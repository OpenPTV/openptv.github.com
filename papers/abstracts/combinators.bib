  abstract = {Constraint combination methods are essential for a
flexible constraint programming system. This paper
presents deep concurrent constraint combinators
based on computation spaces as combination
mechanism. It introduces primitives and techniques
needed to program constraint combinators from
computation spaces. The paper applies computation
spaces to a broad range of combinators: negation,
generalized reification, disjunction, and
implication. Even though computation spaces have
been conceived in the context of Oz, they are
mainly programming language independent. This
point is stressed by discussing them here in the
context of Standard ML with concurrency features.},
