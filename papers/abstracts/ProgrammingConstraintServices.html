  This thesis presents design, application, implementation, and
  evaluation of computation spaces as abstractions for
  programming constraint services at a high level.  Spaces are
  seamlessly integrated into a concurrent programming language
  and make constraint-based computations compatible with
  concurrency through encapsulation.
</p>
<p>
  Spaces are applied to search and combinators as essential
  constraint services. State-of-the-art and new search engines
  such as visual interactive search and parallel search are
  covered.  Search is expressive and concurrency-compatible by
  using copying rather than trailing. Search is space and time
  efficient by using recomputation.  Composable combinators, also
  known as deep-guard combinators, stress the control facilities
  and concurrency integration of spaces.
</p>
<p>
  The implementation of spaces comes as an orthogonal extension
  to the implementation of the underlying programming language.
  The resulting implementation is shown to be competitive with
  existing constraint programming systems.
