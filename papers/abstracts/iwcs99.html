<p>Both in computational linguistics and in formal semantics,
tree (or graph) descriptions stated in terms of <i>dominance</i>
have become common.  Yet the issue of how such descriptions are
processed has been little explored.  In this paper, we present
a constraint-based treatment of descriptions: we develop a
formulation in terms of sets, which is simple and declarative, and,
at the same time, constitutes an efficient implementation.  We further
show how the treatement of tree descriptions can be extended to
DAG descriptions and apply it to a description-based account of
discourse.</p>
