<p>This paper investigates the potential of constraint programming for
solving set partitioning problems occurring in crew scheduling, where
constraint programming is restricted to not employ external solvers, as
for instance integer linear programming solvers. We evaluate
preprocessing steps known from the OR literature on moderately sized set
partitioning problems. Further, we propose a new preprocessing technique
which allows to reduce problem size more effectively than standard
preprocessing techniques but with similar computational
effort. Additionally, we propose a propagation algorithm for a global
set partitioning constraint which, compared with other constraint
programming approaches, finds and proves optimal solutions significantly
faster resp. produces better solutions in a given time period.</p>
