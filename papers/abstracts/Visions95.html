<p>We present Oz as a programming language that 
naturally encompasses multiple styles of programming, 
including (constraint) logic, functional, and concurrent
object-oriented programming. 
This has been achieved by providing a common underlying
foundation for these styles by means of a simple formal model
in the concurrent constraint paradigm.
An integrative programming model is argued to be useful
for foundational as well as practical reasons, 
and is illustrated by means of paradigmatical code examples.</p>
