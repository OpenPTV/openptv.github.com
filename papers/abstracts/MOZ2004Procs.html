This book contains the thoroughly refereed extended postproceedings of
the Second International Mozart/Oz Conference, MOZ 2004, held in
Charleroi, Belgium in October 2004.  In addition to 23 papers taken from
the workshop, the book also includes two invited papers that were
written especially for it and a foreword by Peter Norvig.  The papers are
organized in topical sections on language-based computer security,
computer science education, software engineering, human-computer interfaces
and the Web, distributed programming, grammars and natural language,
constraint programming, and constraint applications.
