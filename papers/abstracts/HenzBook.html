Concurrent constraint programming (ccp) is a recent development
in programming language design. Its central contribution is the
notion of partial information provided by a shared constraint
store. This constraint store serves as a communication medium
between concurrent threads of control and as a vehicle for their
synchronization.
</p>
<p>
Objects for Concurrent Constraint Programming analyzes the
possibility of supporting object-oriented programming in
ccp. Starting from established approaches, the book covers
various object models and discusses their properties. Small Oz, a
sublanguage of the ccp language Oz, is used as a model language
for this analysis. This book presents a general-purpose object
system for Small Oz and describes its implementation and
expressivity for concurrent computation.
</p>
<p>
Objects for Concurrent Constraint Programming is written for
programming language researchers with an interest in programming
language aspects of concurrency, object-oriented programming, or
constraint programming. Programming language implementors will
benefit from the rigorous treatment of the efficient
implementation of Small Oz. Oz programmers will get a first-hand
view of the design decisions that lie behind the Oz object
system.
