<p>
The programming language Oz integrates the paradigms
of imperative, functional and concurrent constraint programming
in a computational framework of unprecedented breadth,
featuring 
stateful programming through cells,
lexically scoped higher-order programming,
and explicit concurrency synchronized by logic variables.
<P>
Object-oriented programming is another paradigm
that provides a set of concepts useful in software practice.
In this thesis we address the question how object-oriented
programming can be suitably supported in Oz.
As a lexically scoped higher-order language, Oz can express a wide range
of object-oriented concepts. We present a simple yet expressive object
system, demonstrate its usability and outline an 
efficient implementation.
A central aspect of Oz is its support for concurrent computation.
We examine the impact of concurrency on the design of an object
system and explore the use of objects in concurrent programming.</p>
