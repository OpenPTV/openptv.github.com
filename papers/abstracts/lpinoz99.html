This short tutorial explains how to do Prolog-style logic
programming in Oz.  We give programming examples that can be run
interactively on the Mozart system, which implements Oz.  The Oz
language is the result of a decade of research into programming
based on logic.  The Oz computation model subsumes both
search-based logic programming and committed-choice (concurrent)
logic programming with deep guards.  Furthermore, Oz provides new
abilities, such as first-class top levels and constant-time
merge, that exist in neither of its ancestors.  We show two of
the Oz interactive graphic tools, namely the Browser and the
Explorer, which are useful for developing and running logic
programs.  We conclude by explaining why logic programming is
just a prelude to the real strengths of Oz, namely constraint
programming and distributed programming.  In these two areas, Oz
is equal to or better than any other system existing in the world
today.  For example, for compute-intensive constraint problems Oz
provides parallel search engines that can be used transparently,
i.e., without changing the problem specification.
