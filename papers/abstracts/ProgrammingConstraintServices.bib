" This thesis presents design, application, implementation, and
  evaluation of computation spaces as abstractions for
  programming constraint services at a high level.  Spaces are
  seamlessly integrated into a concurrent programming language
  and make constraint-based computations compatible with
  concurrency through encapsulation.

  Spaces are applied to search and combinators as essential
  constraint services. State-of-the-art and new search engines
  such as visual interactive search and parallel search are
  covered.  Search is expressive and concurrency-compatible by
  using copying rather than trailing. Search is space and time
  efficient by using recomputation.  Composable combinators, also
  known as deep-guard combinators, stress the control facilities
  and concurrency integration of spaces.

  The implementation of spaces comes as an orthogonal extension
  to the implementation of the underlying programming language.
  The resulting implementation is shown to be competitive with
  existing constraint programming systems.",
