This lecture introduces concurrent constraint
programming in
     Mozart/Oz and shows how to model natural language processing on
basis
     of this paradigm. The lecture addresses students
     of computer science who are interested in constraint programming
     or Mozart/Oz and students of computational linguistics who
     want to learn natural language processing with modern
     programming technology beyond Prolog and LISP.
<p>
    The following topics are introduced, all of which come with running
    programs and lots of practical exercises:

      functional programming and data structures in Mozart/Oz,
      chart parsing for context free grammars,
      unification based parsing,
      concurrent constraint programming,
      constraint solving for scope underspecification in natural
language semantics,
      constraint solving for parsing with dependency grammar.

<p>
   The lectures presupposes as few knowledge as possible, so that it can

   address students of computer science and computational linguistics
   simultaneously.
