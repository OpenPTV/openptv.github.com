<p>
This dissertation presents a study on the extent and limits of <em>network
transparency</em> in distributed programming languages.  This property states
that the result of a distributed program is the same as if it were executed on
a single computer, in the case when no failure occurs.  The programming
language may also be <em>network aware</em> if it allows the programmer to
control how a program is distributed and how it behaves on the network.  Both
aim at simplifying distributed programming, by making non-functional aspects of
a program more modular.
</p>
<p>
We show that network transparency is not only possible, but also
<em>practical</em>: it can be efficient, and smoothly extended in the case of
partial failure.  We give a proof of concept with the programming language Oz
and the system Mozart, of which we have reimplemented the distribution support
on top of the <a href="http://dss.sics.se">Distribution Subsystem (DSS)</a>.
We have extended the language to control which distribution algorithms are used
in a program, and reflect partial failures in the language.  Both extensions
allow to handle non-functional aspects of a program without breaking the
property of network transparency.
