  This thesis presents constraint propagation in
  Mozart which is based on computational agents called propagators.
  The thesis designs, implements, and evaluates propagator-based propagation
  engines.  A propagation engine is split up in generic propagation
  services and domain specific domain solvers which are connected by a
  constraint programming interface. Propagators use filters to perform
  constraint propagation. The interface isolates filters from
  propagators such that they can be shared among various systems.

<p> This thesis presents the design and implementation of
a finite integer set domain solver for Mozart which reasons over
bound and cardinality approximations of sets. The solver cooperates
with a finite domain solver to improve its propagation and
expressiveness.

<p>
This thesis promotes constraints to first-class
citizens and thus, provides extra control over constraints. Novel
programming techniques taking advantage of the first-class status of
constraints are developed and illustrated.
