<p>We investigate functional computation as a special form 
of concurrent computation. As formal basis, we use a 
uniformly confluent core of the <img src="pi.gif" alt="pi">-calculus,
which is
also contained in models of higher-order concurrent
constraint programming. We embed the call-by-need 
and the call-by-value <img src="lambda.gif" alt="lambda">-calculus
into the
<img src="pi.gif" alt="pi">-calculus. We prove that call-by-need
complexity is
dominated by call-by-value complexity. In contrast to 
the recently proposed call-by-need <img src="lambda.gif"
alt="lambda">-calculus,
our concurrent call-by-need model incorporates mutual 
recursion and can be extended to cyclic data structures 
by means of constraints.</p>
