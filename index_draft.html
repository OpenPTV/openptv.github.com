  <h1>Mozart in a nutshell</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    The Mozart Programming System combines research in programming language design
    and implementation, constraint logic programming, distributed computing, and 
    human-computer interfaces.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mozart provides expressive power and advanced functionality.
    Its 64-bit implementation supports modern architectures and provides both 
    compiled and REPL interpreter execution for incremental development and experimentation.
  </p>
    
<p>

  If you're interested in languages or looking for a new platform to support
  distributed computing research we're confident you will find Mozart has 
  something to offer.

    <h2>Distribution</h2>

    <p>

      Distribution is pervasive in modern ICT systems. Mozart has achieved
      novel results in open and transparent distribution. It is used in ongoing
      research in Distributed Systems and Algorithms, supporting such
      accomplishments as a distributed unification algorithm, the Selfman
      peer-to-peer project, and CRDT (conflict-free replicated data-type)
      research.

    <h2>Multiparadigm</h2>
    <p>
      
      Mozart builds many commonly known but typically disparate programming
      models upon a simple procedural kernel with a well-defined and complete
      semantics. It includes procedural, functional, object, logic and
      constraint programming models, which may coexist in Oz programs, enabling
      its users to select the most suitable paradigm for a task.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      
      Mozart has been used as a teaching language for several years by UCL, KTH and ...

      Its multiparadigm trait provides a common starting point for complete
      pedagogic coverage of the various common programming paradigms.
