    <h2><a name=intro>Introductory</a></h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="tutorial/index.html" class=section name=tutorial>Tutorial of Oz</a></dt>
      <dd><p>provides an easy introduction to this rich and many faceted
language. It covers major issues of syntax, semantics, programming
paradigms, and design.  All programming concepts are illustrated with
code snipets which the reader is encouraged to try for himself.</p>

      <dt><a href="dstutorial/index.html" class=section name=dstutorial>Distributed Programming in Mozart</a></dt>
      <dd><p>shows how to write efficient and robust distributed
applications with the Mozart programming system.
It presents and motivates the distribution model and
the basic primitives needed for building distributed applications.
It then progressively introduces
examples of distributed applications
to illustrate servers,
agents, mobility, collaborative tools,
fault tolerance, and security.</p>

      <dt><a href="fdt/index.html" class=section name=fdt>Finite Domain Constraint
Programming</a></dt>
      <dd><p>introduces the reader to the art of constraint
programming in Oz.  The approach rests on the two complementary
techniques of constraint propagation and constraint distribution.
Constraint propagation is an efficient inference mechanism obtained
with concurrent propagators accumulating information in a constraint
store. Constraint distribution splits a problem into complementary
cases once constraint propagation cannot advance further.  The
tutorial focuses on combinatorial problems that can be
stated with variables ranging over finite sets of nonnegative
integers.  Problems in this class range from puzzles to real world
applications as diverse as scheduling, ware house allocation,
configuration and placement.</p>

      <dt><a href="apptut/index.html" class=section name=apptut
	     >Application Programming</a></dt>
      <dd><p>introduces the reader to the art of designing and creating
stand-alone applications in Oz, and puts great emphasis on
<em>modular</em> development.  Many design patterns are discussed and
illustrated with small programs, eg concurrency, client/server
applications, and distributed applications.  The tutorial also reveals
how trivial it is to interface with C/C++.</p>

    <h2><a name=advanced>Advanced</a></h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="fst/index.html" class=section name=fst
>Problem Solving With Finite Set Constraints</a></dt>
      <dd><p>illustrates how difficult problems can be modelled
elegantly and solved efficiently with finite sets constraints.</p>

      <dt><a href="wp/index.html" class=section name=wp>Window Programming</a></dt>
      <dd><p>introduces the reader to the art of creating graphical user
interfaces
for Oz application. It documents and illustrates extensively Mozart's
high-level object-oriented interface to Tk.  Every trick is
illustrated with a code fragment and the corresponding graphical
picture.  The reader is highly encouraged to try each example as he
works his way through the tutorial.</p>

      <dt><a href="op/index.html" class=section name=op>Open Programming</a></dt>
      <dd><p>introduces the reader to the art of creating applications that
communicate with their environment.  It documents and illustrates
Mozart's object-oriented interface to IO facilities, such as files,
sockets, and processes.</p>

      <dt><a href="cpitut/index.html" class=section name=cpitut
>Constraint Extension Tutorial</a></dt>
      <dd><p>provides the knowledge to go beyond the built-in constraint capabilities of Mozart. It explains how to implement propagators and  constraint systems in C++ and shows integration and usage of linear programming solvers.
