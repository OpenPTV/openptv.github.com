The <A href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/mogul/">MOGUL</A> infrastructure was revised and extended to transparently provide support for both. Packages contributed in one format are now automatically also converted and made available in the other format. <CODE>ozmake</CODE> now uses Mozart version-specific areas to install packages so that you can have both 1.2.* and 1.3.* versions of Mozart installed on your system. Furthermore, <CODE>ozmake</CODE> has been modified to download packages from the version-specific area of MOGUL appropriate for the version of Mozart that you are running. Unfortunately, this means that an old version of <CODE>ozmake</CODE> will not know that it needs to access an appropriate area; however, you can easily configure it to do so with the following command: </P><BLOCKQUOTE class="code"><CODE>ozmake&nbsp;--config=put&nbsp;--archive=http://www.mozart-oz.org/mogul/pkg/1.2.5/source</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE><P> After that, <CODE>ozmake&nbsp;--install&nbsp;--package&nbsp;mogul:/duchier/select</CODE> will once again work as expected, download the named package from the 1.2.5 area in MOGUL and install it on your system.</P><H3><A name="label12">3.1.2 Bug Fixes</A></H3><P>A bug which sometimes caused <CODE>ozmake</CODE> to hang after downloading a package has been fixed. The compiler bug that was responsible was fixed and a workaround was also added to ozmake in case someone compiles it with a compiler that still has the bug. </P><P>syntax errors discovered while scanning functors for automatically extracting dependencies are now reported nicely </P></DIV><TABLE align="center" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="6" class="nav"><TR bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><TD><A href="node10.html">- Up -</A></TD><TD><A href="node12.html#section.m131.changes">Next &gt;&gt;</A></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><ADDRESS><SPAN class="version">Version 1.4.0 (20080702)</SPAN></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>
