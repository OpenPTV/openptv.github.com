# History


### How it started 
OpenPTV is based on the core algorithms developed at ETH Zurich, see [3D-PTV](http://3dptv.github.com). The branches of the Zurich code have been developed independently by TU/e group of [Turbulence and Vortex Dynamics](http://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/applied-physics/research/transport-physics/turbulence-and-vortex-dynamics-wdy/) (C++ version with Tcl/Tk and few new algorithms of general coordinate transformation) and by the [Turbulence Structure Laboratory](http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/turbulencelab) at Tel Aviv University (Python version, PyPTV). Following the meeting at TU/e in October 2012, the three groups (ETH, TU/e and TAU) decided to release their software under open source licenses.
