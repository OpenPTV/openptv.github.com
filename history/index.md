Oz has existed in several forms prior to Mozart 2. Here are the ones we know of.

Mozart 2. *No longer supported*.

### The DFKI Oz 2 System

All features of [DFKI Oz 2](http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/oz2/) are subsumed by
Mozart. *No longer supported*.

### The DFKI Oz 1 System

[Oz 1 is still available](http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/oz1/) as documentation
of how Oz evolved and for those interested in an ultraconcurrent programming
language. For all practical concerns use Mozart. *No longer supported*.
